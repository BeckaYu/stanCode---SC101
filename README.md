# stanCode-101: Programming Abstraction
Hello, I'm Rebecca Yu 👋

## 👩‍💻 About Me
In May 2023, I shifted gears from Product Management to aspiring Data Analyst, immersing myself in Python through stanCode's rich curriculum. My sights are set on breaking into the U.S. data scene, with plans to apply to an MSBA program in 2024.

## 💛 My Journey
This repo captures my growth and unwavering commitment. Here, I've conquered 4 assignments, each sharpening my skills in areas like loops, conditions, functions, arithmetic, string manipulation, and even image processing with SimpleImage. Dive into the files to explore my solutions and thought process.

### Assignments at a Glance:
