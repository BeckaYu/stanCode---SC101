# stanCode-101: Programming Abstraction
Hello, I'm Rebecca Yu 👋

## 👩‍💻 About Me
In May 2023, I shifted gears from Product Management to aspiring Data Analyst, immersing myself in Python through stanCode's rich curriculum. My sights are set on breaking into the U.S. data scene, with plans to apply to an MSBA program in 2024.

## 💛 My Journey
This repo is all about my coding adventure and the progress I've made so far. Within, I've tackled four assignments (with two currently in progress), each honing my abilities in Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples), Web Crawling via BeautifulSoup, Recursion, and Linked Lists. 

### Assignments at a Glance:
- **Assignment 1:** Basic implementation on **Object-Oriented Programming** - Bouncing Ball
- **Assignment 2:** Advanced application on **Object-Oriented Programming** - Breakout Game
- **Assignment 3:** Implementation using **Data Structure(list, dict, tuple)** - Self-crafted PhotoShop
- **Assignment 4:** Implementation combining **Data Structures** with a **Web Crawler** (BeautifulSoup) - Search for Baby Names
- **Assignment 5:** Implementation of **Recursion** in algorithms - Search for Anagrams
- **Assignment 6:** Implementation of **Data Structures** and **Linked Lists** - LC212: Boggle Game

## 💻 About stanCode 101
