# stanCode-101: Programming Abstraction
Hello, I'm Rebecca Yu 👋

## 👩‍💻 About Me
In May 2023, I shifted gears from Product Management to aspiring Data Analyst, immersing myself in Python through stanCode's rich curriculum. My sights are set on breaking into the U.S. data scene, with plans to apply to an MSBA program in 2024.

## 💛 My Journey
This repo is all about my coding adventure and the progress I've made so far. I’ve wrapped up four assignments (and got two more on the go), each one upping my game in cool stuff like Object-Oriented Programming, messing around with Data Structures (think lists, dictionaries, and tuples), Web Crawling with BeautifulSoup, Recursion, and Linked Lists.

### Assignments at a Glance:
- **Assignment 1:** Basic implementation on **Object-Oriented Programming** - Bouncing Ball
- **Assignment 2:** Advanced application on **Object-Oriented Programming** - Breakout Game
- **Assignment 3:** Implementation using **Data Structure(list, dict, tuple)** - Self-crafted PhotoShop
- **Assignment 4:** Implementation combining **Data Structures** with a **Web Crawler** (BeautifulSoup) - Search for Baby Names
- **Assignment 5:** Implementation of **Recursion** in algorithms - Anagram (Work In Progress)
- **Assignment 6:** Implementation of **Data Structures** and **Linked Lists** - Boggle Game (Work In Progress)

## 💻 About stanCode 101
At the heart of my learning journey is **stanCode**, a brainchild of Stanford MSc. grad Jerry, dedicated to delivering Stanford-grade CS education to students across disciplines in Taiwan. **stanCode 101**, drawing inspiration from Stanford’s CS106B, lays a solid groundwork in programming.
